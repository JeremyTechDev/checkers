# Checkers
Final project for ISC-105 at PUCMM

This is a C programming language terminal game that simulates a Checkers game between to human players. It saves statistics for each player and a resume of the steps taken on each game.

## Requirements

- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

## Execution

To start running the program, just run `make start` in a terminal at the root of the project. This command will start the program after compiling it with `gcc`.

You can also just recompile the program by running `make compile`.

Or just type `make` in the terminal to list all the possible commands for the program.

### Notes

The program was developed in `Ubuntu 20.10`. This might result into trouble for Windows users.
